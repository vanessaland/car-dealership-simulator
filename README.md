# car-dealership-simulator
### This is my final project for my class, Computer Science II
It is a program that simulates a car dealership. It can simulate the process of a car transaction such as purchases and returns, with transaction IDs, specific sales representatives, and full description of the car type. The car data can be sorted, filtered, and shortlisted.

I used object oriented and modular programming in Java. I used the Eclipse IDE to create this. My final mark for this assignment was 100%.
